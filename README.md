# SimpleShoppingCart

This is a Kata try on practicing TDD with all its advantages especially the ability to refactor the code with confidence thanks to automatic tests which guarantee to check that program functionnalities are not altered after refactoring.

We tried to apply "SOLID" principales, "design patterns" and "clean code" recommandations to ensure

Maintenability
Extensability
Modularity
Testability
Reusability

Feel free to comment or recommand any improvement anytime :).
